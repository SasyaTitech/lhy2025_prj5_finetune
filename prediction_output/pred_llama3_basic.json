Conversely, those who accumulate too many negative points could be restricted in their movements or subjected to increased supervision. \nA third solution could be to implement a community service program, where inmates are required to perform a certain number of hours of community service each week.

One day, you notice that a large oil spill has occurred nearby and you begin to observe changes in the behavior of the dolphins.\nYou notice that the dolphins are swimming in smaller groups than usual and seem to be avoiding certain areas of the Gulf. They also appear to be vocalizing more frequently and at higher frequencies than normal.\nYour hypothesis is that the oil spill has affected the dolphins' ability to communicate with each other and has disrupted their social behavior. This could potentially lead to a decrease in their reproductive success and long-term consequences for the pod's survival.\nUsing current research and data, propose a detailed plan for testing your hypothesis.
