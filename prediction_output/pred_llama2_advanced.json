The three cafes are named Caf\u00e9 A, Caf\u00e9 B, and Caf\u00e9 C. \nYour task is to assign each caf\u00e9 a category based on your personalized criteria. The categories are: Cozy, Modern, or Rustic. You have to provide a detailed explanation of why you chose that category for each caf\u00e9.\nCaf\u00e9 A: This caf\u00e9 has warm lighting, comfortable seating, and soft background music. It also has a fireplace and a bookshelf with a variety of books. Based on these features, which category would you assign to Caf\u00e9 A?\nCaf\u00e9 B: This caf\u00e9 has bright lighting, colorful decorations, and upbeat music. The seating is modern and sleek, and the walls are covered in abstract art. Based on these features, which category would you assign to Caf\u00e9 B?\nCaf\u00e9 C: This caf\u00e9 has dim lighting, wooden tables and chairs, and jazz music playing in the background. The walls are decorated with vintage posters and there are exposed brick walls. Based on these features, which category would you assign to Caf\u00e9 C?\nThink carefully and use multiple-step reasoning, including factors such as decor, lighting, and music, to assign each caf\u00e9 to the appropriate category. Good luck!"

Your goal is to come up with a system that will limit the freedom of the inmates without taking away their lives. \nOne potential solution could be to create a rotating system of confinement, where inmates are confined to a small cell for a specific period of time before rotating to another cell. This would limit their freedom of movement but still allow them to interact with other inmates in the common area during designated times. \nAnother solution could be to implement a points system, where inmates earn points for good behavior and lose points for misbehavior. Inmates who accumulate a certain number of points could be granted additional privileges, such as access to educational programs or increased time in the common area. Conversely, those who accumulate too many negative points could be restricted in their movements or subjected to increased supervision. \nA third solution could be to implement a community service program, where inmates are required to perform a certain number of hours of community service each week. This would limit their freedom of movement but still allow them to contribute to society in a positive way. \nUltimately, the goal is to find creative solutions that recognize the value of human life while still satisfying society's need for justice.
