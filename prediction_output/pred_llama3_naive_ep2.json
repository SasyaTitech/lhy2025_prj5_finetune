Inmates who accumulate a certain number of points could be granted additional privileges, such as access to educational programs or increased time in the common area. Conversely, those who accumulate too many negative points could be restricted in their movements or subjected to increased supervision. \nA third solution could be to implement a community service program, where inmates are required to perform a certain number of hours of community service each week. This would limit their freedom of movement but still allow them to contribute to society in a positive way. \nUltimately, the goal is to find creative solutions that recognize the value of human life while still satisfying society's need for justice.
